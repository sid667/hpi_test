Digital preservation is a rapidly evolving set of standards and practices that increase the longevity and accessibility of digital information. Although some digital preservation concepts evolved from conservation and preservation of physical materials and artifacts, digital preservation is fundamentally different in scope, scale, and practice. Digital preservation is a distributed process that requires coordination between the producers of digital assets and the organizations, systems, and people who assume responsibility for their long-term accessibility.  Effective digital preservation depends on aligning technical approaches and organizational solutions with the characteristics of the digital content, the known or anticipated uses of the content, and the technical, financial, and human resources available to invest in extending the life of digital content.
